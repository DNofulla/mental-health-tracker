# Mental Health Tracker

A mental health journal application designed to help users keep track of their mental health by writing daily journals! Users can either make their journals public or they can make them private for themselves to see. This app was made so that users can get into daily journaling so that they can monitor their mental health daily based on how they feel. If need be they can also access CDC Mental Health Resources to try and get help if they feel like they have mental health problems that need to be addressed.
